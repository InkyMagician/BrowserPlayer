# Mini Browser-Based Video Player (Work in Progress)

## Overview

This project aims to create a lightweight, browser-based video player designed for smooth playback and effortless skipping through videos, particularly useful for movies and anime. Please note that this project is still under development and facing some challenges.

## Motivation

As an avid watcher of movies and anime, I often find myself wanting to skip through less interesting parts. While using traditional media players like VLC or GOM Player, I noticed they often stutter when rewinding or fast-forwarding. This led me to the idea of creating this mini player, leveraging the smooth playback capabilities of web browsers.

## Current State

The player is currently in development and facing challenges, particularly with .ts file playback. While the concept is promising, implementation has proven more complex than initially anticipated.

## Planned Features

- Smooth rewinding and fast-forwarding without stuttering
- Simple, intuitive interface
- Support for various video formats, including .ts files
- Lightweight and easy to use

## Known Issues

- .ts files are not currently supported and fail to play
- Some video formats may not be compatible with browser-based playback
- The player is not yet fully functional for all intended use cases

## Next Steps

- Investigate and implement a solution for .ts file playback
- Improve overall compatibility with various video formats
- Enhance the user interface and playback controls
